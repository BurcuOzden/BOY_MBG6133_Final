### Overview
EvOdNumCheck generates a random matrix and plots two heatmaps of this matrix accordinly:
1. The heatmap is plotted according to values of the cells.
2. The heatmap is plotted according to even/odd characteristics of the cells.

### Details

EvOdNumCheck repository is generated for International Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Institute MBG6133 Final Exam. The repository has three folders: **_Exam_**, **_Scripts_** and **_Outputs_**. The contents of folders are as follow:

- **_[Exam](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/EvOdNumCheck/tree/main/Exam)_** folder contains the related exam paper.
- **_[Scripts](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/EvOdNumCheck/tree/main/Scripts)_** folder contains _EvOdNumCheck.ipnyb_ script that generates the outputs of the exam.
- **_[Outputs](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/EvOdNumCheck/tree/main/Outputs)_** folder contains the generated heatmaps as outputs.


_[EvOdNumCheck.ipnyb](https://github.com/BurcuOzden/EvOdNumCheck/blob/main/Scripts/EvOdNumCheck.ipynb)_ script is generated to answer the questions that are given in the exam. This script is generated by using jupyter notebook. If you do not have jupyter notebook in your computer, you can download Anaconda package from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The script performs below points in order:
1. It generates a random matrix of size 100x100. It is an integer matrix and the cell values are between 0 and 100.
2. 2D heatmap of matrix are plotted to visualize the cell values. The heatmap is saved with the name of _heatmap_randomarray_ in pdf format at 300 dpi resolution. The file is presented in _Outputs_ folder.
3. The cells are categorized as False and True according to their even/odd characteristics. If the cell contains an odd number, it is labeled as True and otherwise it is labeled as False.
4. False/True labels of the matrix are converted into 0 and 1 representation. Odd numbers that are labeled as True are represented with 1 and remaining even numbers are represented with 0.
5. Finally, the matrix contains zeros and ones are plotted as 2D heatmap to visualize the even/odd characteristics of the cells. The heatmap is saved with the name of _heatmap_even_odd_ in pdf format at 300 dpi resolution. The file is presented in _Outputs_ folder.

**Note 1:** This script does not requires any input file. It automatically generates a random matrix and generates heatmaps from this matrix.

**Note 2:** The first two points are the answer of the first question and the last three points are the answer of the second question.
